# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here
### Features
PC-EZ will have individual user account functionality, wikipedia-style information pages for manufacturers and parts, and side-by-side comparison tables.
### Technologies
PC-EZ is built using C#, .NET, and MySQL.
### What I'll Have to Learn
I would like to eventually integrate an API to fetch live price information from online retailers, but that is one of the lower-priority features. I'd also like to learn to store picture files (or URLs) into my database, so that users can have profile pictures.
